# Foundations of Computation Social Systems Project

In this repository you will find our code for our project in the class [Foundations of Computational Soicial Systems](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/FoundationsOfCSS).

The project focuses on the gender bias in book recommender systems. Therefore we implemented a weightbased and itembased recommender system in R. The dataset used for this project is based on user rating from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). It can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bahramjannesarr/goodreads-book-datasets-10m).

A live version of this repo can be found at [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/project/GoodBookGenderBias-vxQYc24QQDqTd4I4L2yTFA/%2Fnotebook.ipynb).

## Data retrieval
To load the data first run the download_data notebook with an python kernel on deepnote.
We didn't test it on jypther or other notebooks.

## Run notebook
For the data analysis run the notebook.ipynb with a R kernel. Only tested with R 4.0.4.
